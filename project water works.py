import csv file
open csv file = {http://localhost:8888/edit/water}

# Well, that didn't work so I will move on to trying to use genfromtxt

import numpy as np
data = https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Water-Consumption-In-The-New-York-City/ia2d-e54m
>>> np.genfromtxt(data, 0)
print(np)


# In[6]:


#import numpy at np
open data = (http://localhost:8888/edit/water)
np.genfromtxt('data')


# while I cannot fully execute code, I will however provide a part of the code relative to the function requested.
